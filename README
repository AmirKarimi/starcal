Notes:
    You can have starcal2 (version >= 1.9.0) and starcal (version <= 1.5.3) packages
    installed on your system in one time. They are completely independent.
    Command "starcal2" runs starcal2, and command "starcal" runs older starcal (1.5.3)
    Also command "starcal2-qt" runs starcal2 with PyQt interface (default is PyGTK).
    starcal2-qt is added newly, and exits in the same package starcal2
